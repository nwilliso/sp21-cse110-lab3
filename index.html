                <h3>Summary of the day:</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, I had a relatively <strong>bad</strong> day. 
                    <br>
                    First, I had to go to work to open in the morning, and <em>I am <b>not</b> a morning person</em>. Then, when I got back home, my roommate told me he tested <i>positive</i> for covid. I had to then get a test with my other roommate and had to tell my boss about my roommate. I stayed inside for the rest of the day, happy that I opened alone this morning.
                </p>

                <h3>Summary of the day:</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, I had a relatively <strong>good</strong> day.
                    <br>
                    Originally I had to work this morning, but since my roommate tested positive the day before, <em>I got to sleep in</em>. Later in the day, I got a <i>positive</i> test result back and so did my other roommate. My word of advice is to never get covid because you get <b>way too many calls</b>. I had to talk to UCSD's SHS many times that day, San Diego County, and my work's corporate office. So far, sounds like it was not a good day, but in reality, this positive test meant that I get time to relax and not go to work. I didn't go out anyway besides for work so isolating was easy. I decided to buy some video games for my switch so I could play with my roommates.

                    This is a song from <i>Monty Python's Life of Brian</i> and it's relevant because I have to look on the bright side of being sick.

                    Overall, I had a relatively <strong>great</strong> day.
                    <br>
                    The day started off bad because there were still <b>more calls</b>, but not as many as the previous day. After watching lectures for school, I played some video games with my roommates and watched <i>Monty Python's Life of Brian</i> (if you have not watched it, it is a <em>hilarious</em> movie). We also watched <i>Parasite</i> which was also very good. It was a very relaxing day.
